Advent of Code 2018 Solutions
=============================

Look at my hastily written, non-optimal NodeJS solutions here.

```
yarn install

cd day1
node solve.js
```

Generally going for a super naive approach that is fastest to write/test to see how quickly I can get the answer as this
seems like the optimal approach to get on the leaderboards. Also being in the right timezone and avoiding evening
commitments!
